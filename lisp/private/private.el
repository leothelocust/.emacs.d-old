;;; private.el --- Custom functions and bindings

;; AUTHOR: Levi Olson <olson.levi@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Its important to keep these outside of the main folder structure so as to
;; avoid version control issues.

;;; Code:

(load "_functions")
(load "_bindings")


(provide 'private)

;;; private.el ends here
